# My Linux Scripts

> These are some helper scripts I use on my Linux machines.

## What's Here?
 - brightness_*.sh: control the brightness on my Razer Blade 15, with nice gui.
 - volume_*.sh: control the volume and mute on my Razer Blade 15, with nice gui.

## Older Scripts
The `lenovo/rotation_stuff.sh` script allows screen rotation to work, along with touch screen and wacom pen on my old Lenovo Yoga 720.

## Requirements
Some additional things required are `dunst` & `rumno`.

YMMV

If you find this useful, please consider buying me a tea or coffee.
